# Black Hat Go Notes

Welcome to my repository of notes and code examples from the book ["Black Hat Go: Go Programming For Hackers and Pentesters"](https://nostarch.com/blackhatgo) by Tom Steele, Chris Patten, and Dan Kottmann. This book is a fantastic resource for anyone interested in using Go for security, hacking, and penetration testing.

## About the Book

"Black Hat Go" explores the powerful capabilities of the Go programming language in the context of offensive security. The book covers a wide range of topics, from writing simple network clients, to implementing complex command and control (C2) systems.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized chapter-wise, mirroring the structure of the book. Each folder contains my personal notes and code examples that I've written while exploring the concepts presented in each chapter.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the notes and code examples. They are meant to be supplementary material for your own journey through "Black Hat Go."

## Acknowledgments

A big thank you to the authors of "Black Hat Go" for their invaluable insights into Go and its application in the field of security.
